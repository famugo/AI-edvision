1
00:00:00,115 --> 00:00:05,635
We all suffer losses.

2
00:00:05,635 --> 00:00:11,435
We all are going to have highs and lows in our lives.

3
00:00:11,435 --> 00:00:18,515
We can all be petrified of what the future may hold and we can all have setbacks and

4
00:00:18,515 --> 00:00:22,115
doubts and pain.

5
00:00:22,115 --> 00:00:24,835
That's what's going to happen in life.

6
00:00:24,835 --> 00:00:30,755
But if you fight for it and you work for it and you work through it, those losses and

7
00:00:30,755 --> 00:00:38,515
those setbacks and that pain will make you better.

8
00:00:38,515 --> 00:00:41,835
You can drive on.

9
00:00:41,835 --> 00:00:44,115
You can push through.

10
00:00:44,115 --> 00:00:53,835
You can deal with unimaginable adversity as long as you keep getting up every day and

11
00:00:53,835 --> 00:00:56,035
keep moving forward.

12
00:00:56,035 --> 00:01:02,555
You have to make yourself better by attacking every day in spite of whatever challenges you

13
00:01:02,555 --> 00:01:13,035
face, go out there, fight on and no matter what, do not give up hope.

14
00:01:13,035 --> 00:01:18,235
When you get tripped up or you get knocked down, what you do is you do the best you can.

15
00:01:18,235 --> 00:01:23,475
You've got to go down swinging and I'll tell you this, if you fight with all that you've

16
00:01:23,475 --> 00:01:30,955
got, more often than not, you don't go down at all, you win, but you've got to make that

17
00:01:30,955 --> 00:01:38,715
attitude part of your everyday life, the extra rep, the extra mile, the extra round, stand

18
00:01:38,715 --> 00:01:51,435
and fight against weakness and against fear, fight back, go down swinging, give every day

19
00:01:51,435 --> 00:01:53,035
everything you've got.

20
00:01:53,035 --> 00:01:58,475
When you face a challenge, eat at something where you don't believe you can win.

21
00:01:58,475 --> 00:02:03,475
Remember this, you have nothing to lose.

22
00:02:03,475 --> 00:02:10,595
So stand up and go forward and go out in a blaze of glory, fighting with everything

23
00:02:10,595 --> 00:02:18,475
you've got, every ounce of energy, every beat is sweat, every drop of blood, never give

24
00:02:18,475 --> 00:02:26,075
up, over against overwhelming odds, never accept the fear, persevere, and endure until

25
00:02:26,075 --> 00:02:29,075
the end.

26
00:02:29,075 --> 00:02:34,075
In this situation that you're in, your life is at stake.

27
00:02:34,075 --> 00:02:37,195
Your life is actually at stake right now.

28
00:02:37,195 --> 00:02:40,875
What you do with your life is at stake.

29
00:02:40,875 --> 00:02:43,195
You are fighting for your life every day.

30
00:02:43,195 --> 00:02:47,995
The way that you live, the mark that you're going to leave, the legacy that you're going

31
00:02:47,995 --> 00:02:52,875
to leave, all that is going to come back to you, that is your life and your life is

32
00:02:52,875 --> 00:03:00,195
at stake right now, every day, so don't sit back and be on the defense and allow life

33
00:03:00,195 --> 00:03:01,195
to happen to you.

34
00:03:01,195 --> 00:03:02,195
Don't do that.

35
00:03:02,195 --> 00:03:08,515
Instead, you go on the offense every day by getting up and getting after it.
